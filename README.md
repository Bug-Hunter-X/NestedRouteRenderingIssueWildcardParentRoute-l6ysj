This repository demonstrates a bug in React Router DOM v6 where nested routes fail to render correctly when a parent route includes a wildcard parameter.  The issue occurs when a nested route attempts to access parameters from a parent route that also has a wildcard parameter.  The solution involves restructuring the routes or utilizing a different approach to access the necessary parameters.
